Mailtrain can be used to track a RSS feed â€“ whenever a new entry appears in that feed, it is converted into a campaign and sent to specified subscribers

### 1. Create a new RSS campaign

When creating a new campaign there is an option to create a RSS campaign instead of "normal" campaign

### 2. Set RSS feed details

When creating the campaign, you need to have a valid RSS url that can be provided for the campaign. In the following example I use the feed URL for [TechCrunch articles](techcrunch.com/feed).

### 3. Activate campaign

By default the feed is not checked and no messages are sent. To actually start sending you need to activate it by hitting on the "Activate" button

### 4. Messages appear as subcampaigns

Whenever a new post is found from the provided feed it is converted into a normal campaign and sent out to the selected list. You can find all these subcampaigns in the footer of the RSS campaign page.
